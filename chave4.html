        <br>
        The club isn't the best place to find a lover <span class="musica">D3->7 O17->1365</span>
            So the bar is where I go <span class="musica">O20->39 L1->2</span>
            Me and my friends at the table doing shots <span class="musica">G9->7</span>
            Drinking fast and then we talk slow <span class="musica">N19->245 P6->2</span>
            
            Come over and start up a conversation with just me <span class="musica">P21->39 O4->3</span>
            And trust me, I'll give it a chance <span class="musica">M1->1 H16->32</span>
            Now take my hand, stop, put Van The Man on the jukebox <span class="musica">T10->28</span>
            And then we start to dance <span class="musica">B15->7 J13->64</span>
            And now I'm singing like <span class="musica">K7->11 L19->?</span>
            
            Girl, you know I want your love <span class="musica">J16->3 N4->4</span>

            Say: Boy, let's not talk too much <span class="musica">J5->33 R21->1520</span>

            I'm in love with your body <span class="musica">C7->1 P19->252</span>
            And last night you were in my room <span class="musica">Q1->1</span>
            And now my bedsheets smell like you <span class="musica">K9->65</span>
            Everyday discovering something brand new <span class="musica">P10->31</span>
            I'm in love with your body <span class="musica">T6->26 N21->59280</span>

            Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate <span class="musica">T18->1943 I7->?</span>

            And how your family is doing okay <span class="musica">P2->2</span>

            White lips, pale face <span class="musica">T9->8</span>

            And she don't wanna go outside tonight <span class="musica">Q14->2</span>
            And in a pipe she flies to the motherland
            Or sells love to another man <span class="musica">P3->6</span>
            It's too cold outside <span class="musica">E13->910</span>

        <br>
            I know it's a bad idea <span class="musica">M8->18 N15->7</span>
            But how can I help myself? <span class="musica">H13->15 B4->4</span>
            Been inside for most this year <span class="musica">F19->330 C6->5830</span>
            And I thought a few drinks, they might help <span class="musica">S6->2 M20->13</span>

            It's been a while, my dear <span class="musica">N3->2 K17->1372</span>
            Dealing with the cards life dealt <span class="musica">B5->? F14->4</span>
            I'm still holding back these tears <span class="musica">S2->2 O14->2</span>
            While my friends are somewhere else <span class="musica">L20->13 T8->2</span>

            I pictured this year a little bit different when it hit February <span class="musica">K10->28</span>
            I stepped in the bar, it hit me so hard <span class="musica">C12->1 M12->5</span>
            Oh, how can it be this heavy? <span class="musica">I1->3 B19->8</span>
            Every song reminds me you're gone <span class="musica">Q11->125</span>
            And I feel the lump form in my throat <span class="musica">I12->1 I19->7</span>
            'Cause I'm here alone <span class="musica">L16->285 J1->1</span>

            Just dancing with my eyes closed <span class="musica">M11->25</span>
            'Cause everywhere I look I still see you <span class="musica">E14->2 S5->49</span>
            Time is moving so slow <span class="musica">F17->4 I5->561</span>
            And I don't know what else that I can do <span class="musica">H7->10</span>
            So I'll keep dancing with my <span class="musica">K8->3 L15->4</span>
            Ey-ey-ey-eyes, ey-ey-ey-eyes closed <span class="musica">H10->28</span>
            Ey-ey-ey-eyes <span class="musica">E2->58 K13->15</span>
            So I'll keep dancing with my <span class="musica">E6->22 J20->13</span>

            Delusion is here again <span class="musica">N20->26 Q6->22</span>
            And I think you'll come home soon <span class="musica">T4->24 F13->65</span>
            A word brings me right back in <span class="musica">H9->6 P20->1014</span>
            Then it's only me that's in this room <span class="musica">E11->5 C5->5</span>
            I guess I could just pretend <span class="musica">G1->1 E16->32</span>
            The colours are more than blue <span class="musica">J7->10 S18->638</span>
            But I lost more than my friend <span class="musica">S3->3 S20->1092</span>
            I can't help but missing you <span class="musica">P15->14 J3->2</span>

            I pictured this month a little bit different, no one is ever ready <span class="musica">Q9->65 C20->2</span>
            And when it unfolds you get in a hole <span class="musica">F8->0 I15->72</span>
            Oh, how can it be this heavy? <span class="musica">C8->0 S21->?</span>
            Everything changes, nothing's the same <span class="musica">J12->5 O16->285</span>
            Except the truth is, now you're gone <span class="musica">Q18->667 F5->18</span>
            And life just goes on <span class="musica">J19->29 C3->15</span>

            So I'm dancing with my eyes closed <span class="musica">Q4->9 E17->3</span>
            'Cause everywhere I look I still see you <span class="musica">Q3->3 R16->285</span>
            Time is moving so slow <span class="musica">E10->3 E20->26</span>
            And I don't know what else that I can do <span class="musica">S8->4 R20->39</span>
            So I'll keep dancing with my <span class="musica">G15->3 Q10->28</span>
            Ey-ey-ey-eyes, ey-ey-ey-eyes closed <span class="musica">O8->6 R14->1</span>
            Ey-ey-ey-eyes <span class="musica">J6->5808 Q12->25 J18->638</span>

            So I'll keep dancing with my <span class="musica">B11->2 C16->2</span>
            Ey-ey-ey-eyes, ey-ey-ey-eyes closed <span class="musica">M21->39 L7->110</span>
            Ey-ey-ey-eyes <span class="musica">R11->750 D14->2</span>
            Oh, I keep dancing with my <span class="musica">H20->26 L11->100</span>

            They're shutting the bar <span class="musica">Q5->17 D13->845</span>
            They're cleaning the floor <span class="musica">Q17->1372 E4->3</span>
            And everyone is already home <span class="musica">R15->2 S9->5</span>
            But I'm on my own <span class="musica">H18->22 M5->850</span>

            Still dancing with my eyes closed <span class="musica">S19->252 Q8->24</span>
            'Cause everywhere I look I still see you <span class="musica">C4->3 H21->78</span>
            Time is moving so slow <span class="musica">F3->98 S14->1</span>
            And I don't know what else that I can do <span class="musica">N7->13310 I21->39</span>
            So I'll keep dancing with my <span class="musica">T20->1131 O5->49(+1)</span>
            Ey-ey-ey-eyes, ey-ey-ey-eyes closed <span class="musica">R2->56 E18->147</span>
            Ey-ey-ey-eyes <span class="musica">O1->1 C17->3</span>

            Oh, I keep dancing with my <span class="musica">M6->242 S17->1870036</span>
            Ey-ey-ey-eyes, ey-ey-ey-eyes closed <span class="musica">E5->15 R12->475</span>
            Ey-ey-ey-eyes <span class="musica">T16->107730 C2->2</span>

            Oh, I keep dancing with my <span class="musica">B12->7 M13->64</span>

        <br>
        <h1 style="color: gray;">Quarto encontro</h1>
        <br>
            Oh, misty eye of the mountain below <span class="musica">F1->5 T19->61992</span>
            Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls <span class="musica">T11->656250</span>
            And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke <span class="musica">M15->28</span>
            Keep watching over Durin's sons <span class="musica">H8->0 P17->1872780</span>

            If this is to end in fire <span class="musica">M9->329550</span>
            Then we should all burn together <span class="musica">G13->?</span>
            Watch the flames climb high <span class="musica">C15->21</span>
            Into the night <span class="musica">P12->500</span>

            Calling out father, oh <span class="musica">F15->21</span>
            Stand by and we will <span class="musica">C1->5 L21->59319</span>
            Watch the flames burn auburn on <span class="musica">O9->5070</span>
            The mountain side <span class="musica">P5->850</span>

            And if we should die tonight <span class="musica">B16->62</span>
            We should all die together <span class="musica">F11->5</span>
            Raise a glass of wine <span class="musica">T15->10</span>
            For the last time <span class="musica">E1->5</span>

            Calling out father, oh <span class="musica">P11->625</span>
            Prepare as we will <span class="musica">D16->64</span>
            Watch the flames burn auburn on <span class="musica">M14->6</span>
            The mountain side <span class="musica">M4->12</span>

            Desolation comes upon the sky <span class="musica">I8->0 B20->30</span>

            Now I see fire <span class="musica">C21->39 H2->58</span>
            Inside the mountain, I see fire <span class="musica">D7->11</span>
            Burning the trees, and I see fire <span class="musica">C14->0</span>
            Hollowing souls, I see fire <span class="musica">M17->1872780</span>
            Blood in the breeze <span class="musica">C18->21 I13->960</span>
            And I hope that you remember me <span class="musica">F9->42</span>

            Oh, should my people fall in <span class="musica">L12->30</span>
            Surely I'll do the same <span class="musica">R19->61740 R5->833</span>
            Confined in mountain holes <span class="musica">J10->896</span>
            We got too close to the flame <span class="musica">J4->12</span>

            Calling out father, oh <span class="musica">D8->0</span>
            Hold fast and we will <span class="musica">B9->7 L18->425546</span>
            Watch the flames burn auburn on <span class="musica">O10->868</span>
            The mountain side <span class="musica">B7->11 O21->2311920</span>

            Desolation comes upon the sky <span class="musica">K6->22</span>

            Now I see fire <span class="musica">F2->2 O19->61740</span>
            Inside the mountains, I see fire <span class="musica">T2->54</span>
            Burning the trees, and I see fire <span class="musica">R3->9</span>
            Hollowing souls, I see fire <span class="musica">P13->1308736</span>
            Blood in the breeze <span class="musica">L10->868</span>
            And I hope that you remember me <span class="musica">N11->125</span>

            And if the night is burning <span class="musica">R7->13431</span>
            I will cover my eyes <span class="musica">H11->5</span>
            For if the dark returns then <span class="musica">F16->96</span>
            My brothers will die <span class="musica">K1->2</span>

            And as the sky's falling down <span class="musica">R13->9152</span>
            It crashed into this lonely town <span class="musica">G12->6</span>
            And with that shadow upon the ground <span class="musica">I17->196</span>
            I hear my people screaming out <span class="musica">F6->5830</span>

            And I see fire <span class="musica">S10->1652</span>
            Inside the mountains, I see fire <span class="musica">B2->62</span>
            Burning the trees, I see fire <span class="musica">Q16->108300</span>
            Hollowing souls, I see fire <span class="musica">I16->96</span>
            Blood in the breeze <span class="musica">D12->6</span>

            I see fire (oh, you know I saw a city burning out) (fire) <span class="musica">E7->11</span>
            And I see fire (feel the heat upon my skin) (fire) <span class="musica">T1->1</span>
            And I see fire (ooh) (fire) <span class="musica">O18->425546 S1->1</span>
            And I see fire burn auburn on the mountain side <span class="musica">K2->58 Q21->59280</span>

        <h1 style="color: gray;">Quinto encontro</h1>
            This is a dark parade <span class="musica">A1->25</span>
            Another rough patch to rain on, to rain on <span class="musica">A21->13</span>
            I know your friends may say <span class="musica">A13->5</span>
            This is a cause for celebration <span class="musica">A18->7</span>
            Hip-hip-hooray, love <span class="musica">A6->265</span>

            Photographs in sepia tones, it's so still <span class="musica">A15->3</span>
            The fire's barely fighting the cold, alone <span class="musica">U17->1363</span>
            There are times when I can feel your ghost <span class="musica">A7->11</span>
            Just when I'm almost letting you go <span class="musica">U4->3</span>
            The cards were stacked against us both <span class="musica">U8->2</span>

            I will always love you, for what it's worth <span class="musica">U12->237000</span>
            We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass <span class="musica">U16->215745</span>
            And I know time may change <span class="musica">U3->3</span>
            The way you think of us

            But I'll remember the way we were
            You were the first full stop
            Love that will never leave <span class="musica">A12->8</span>
            Baby, you will never be lost on me <span class="musica">U20->2223</span>

            This is a goddamn shame <span class="musica">A14->0</span>
            I never wanted to break it <span class="musica">U11->750</span>
            Or leave us tainted <span class="musica">A9->7</span>

            Know I should walk away <span class="musica">U7->13431</span>
            But I just can't replace us
            Or even erase us <span class="musica">A2->31</span>

            The car was stuck, the engine stalled <span class="musica">U1->1</span>
            And both of us got caught out in the snow, alone
            There were times when I forget the lows <span class="musica">A17->1</span>
            And think the highs were all that we'd ever known
            The cards were stacked against us both <span class="musica">U13->79</span>

            I will always love you, for what it's worth <span class="musica">A19->15</span>
            We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
            And I know time may change <span class="musica">A20->15</span>
            The way you think of us <span class="musica">A5->13</span>

            But I'll remember the way we were <span class="musica">A11->3</span>
            You were the first full stop <span class="musica">U18->1239634</span>
            Love that will never leave <span class="musica">U14->1</span>
            Baby, you will never be lost on me <span class="musica">U5->735</span>

            Lost on me <span class="musica">A10->4</span>
            Baby, you will never be lost on me <span class="musica">U9->3</span>
            Lost on me <span class="musica">A3->7</span>

            Well, I will always love you, for what it's worth <span class="musica">U10->59</span>
            We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
            And I know time may change
            The way you think of us <span class="musica">A8->0</span>

            But I'll remember the way we were <span class="musica">U15->2</span>

            Love that will never leave <span class="musica">U6->13</span>
            Baby, you will never be lost on me

            Yeah, yeah, yeah <span class="musica">A16->31</span>
            Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah <span class="musica">U2->27</span>
            Lost on me <span class="musica">A4->7</span>
            Ooh, graffiti on the overpass <span class="musica">U21->1520</span>
